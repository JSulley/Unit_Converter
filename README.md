# Unit Converter
A terminal application that converts a given distance (in inches) to either yards, miles, or furlongs.
It first asks the user to convert to either yards, miles, or furlongs. The program validates the user's response (regardless of capitalization).
The user is then required to input the distance and based on the selected units, the program will use the appropriate method to perform the conversion.
The result is then displayed.
